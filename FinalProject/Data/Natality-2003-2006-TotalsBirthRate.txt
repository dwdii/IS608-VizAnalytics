Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one living baby."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Birth rates are calculated as the number of births divided by total population in the given year(s). When the numerator is"
"sub-set by mother's race, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set for age, race, location and year applies to the"
"denominator population."
"4. The populations displayed and used as the denominator for rates are bridged-race July 1st estimates of the resident"
"population. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#Denominator-Population-Sources."
"5. Birth rates and fertility rates for years 2003-2006 are calculated using the revised intercensal bridged-race series of July"
"1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on October 26, 2012. More information:"
